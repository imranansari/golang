core adjustment:
Move template management to core as part of the Server type. Then a list of templates to parse will be passed to NewServer(), which will then safely parse them and return an error if it didn't work. Also, changing functions to act on Server means the server prefix, etc won't have to be passed anymore because they're part of the server.
