// Display telemach info (frequency distribution, etc) while it runs
// Display options:
// * Console (list of amplitudes by frequency, updated a few times a second)
// * Images (use some library to make a basic graph, keep rewriting the image file, and open it in an external program that automatically displays new versions after detecting changes)
